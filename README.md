# A very brief introduction to biostats in python

For the biostatistics course in medical radiation physics at Lund University.

To launch the jupyter notebook exercise click here  [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/emilljungberg/intro_biostat_python/HEAD)

There are two notebooks:
1. `biostat_python.ipynb`: This is a brief introduction with the background knowledge you need for the exercise.
2. `ovning0.ipynb`: This is the exercise you should do during the session.

The detailed instructions for the lab can be found on Canvas.

## Work with Binder
Binder is a system for working with jupyter notebooks in the browser without having to install anything locally. After clicking the Binder button above it will take you to a new page which will take a minute or two to load. Next you will see a page with the available notebooks in the left hand sidebar. Go to the notebook you want to look at or work with (see above). This will open a new tab. Here you work through the notebook as usual, either you click the play button to run a cell, or you click shift+enter with the cell highlighted.

One thing to remember when working with jupyter notebooks in binder is that your work will not be saved if you were to close the tab. If you have made changes to notebook for your own work, you might want to save it as backup. Use the little cloud icons in the toolbar to save and load your work.
